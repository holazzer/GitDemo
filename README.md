# GitDemo
Homework-madatory git repository to "learn git"

### Case Scenario

`@holazzer` is a programer(me) and he is trying to learn how to use sci-kit learn package `sklearn` and he built a simple demo. But he has trouble using `git`. He is so worried about losing his progress that he commits his code like,every line he writes.(And totally `NOT` because the homework requires at least 5 commits.) When he is done creating a model using Nerual Network Classifier, he doesn't know how to draw the areas in blobs it belongs to. So he left it as a "todo". His friend `@SpotHolder`(also me) provides him with a solution after and commits to his repository.


Okay, so they tried to use fork and pull request, which works great on Github! 

I wish to find partner-in-crime (figuratively) to make a game with. Contact if you're interested.
